            When you ship to production, it's not just about "finding bugs."
            It's about:
            
            Understanding business context âš¡

            AI agents can accelerate your reviews.
            But if you don't know design patterns, security principles, and system architectureâ€¦ you'll miss the issues that actually break systems.
            
            So yes, use AI agents.
            But also learn to architect, not just syntax-check.
            
            That's where the real future of developers lies ðŸš€
