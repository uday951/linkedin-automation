"New AI coding agents launch every weekâ€¦ until you try them in production.

GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit Agent, and CodeWhisperer promise to revolutionize development.
But here's the hard truth ðŸ‘‡

When you build real systems, it's not just about "generating code."
It's about:

Integrating with legacy systems âš¡
Handling edge cases & error scenarios ðŸ”„
Maintaining code that others can understand ðŸ’ª

This is why I keep saying:
ðŸ‘‰ Coding isn't dead.
ðŸ‘‰ Coding has evolved.

New AI agents can accelerate your development.
But if you don't know system design, debugging, and architecture patternsâ€¦ you'll struggle when the generated code breaks.

So yes, try every new agent.
But also learn to think, not just prompt.

That's where the real future of developers lies ðŸš€

What do you think â€” which new AI agent has impressed you most, or are they all just hype?

"Devin AI agent sounds revolutionaryâ€¦ until you see the demo limitations.

Cognition Labs claims their AI can build entire apps, fix bugs, and deploy systems autonomously.
But here's the hard truth ðŸ‘‡

When you need real software, it's not just about "autonomous coding."
It's about:

Understanding business requirements âš¡
Handling complex integrations & APIs ðŸ”„
Debugging issues that require domain knowledge ðŸ’ª

This is why I keep saying:
ðŸ‘‰ Software engineering isn't dead.
ðŸ‘‰ Software engineering has evolved.

Devin and similar agents can handle simple tasks.
But if you don't know system architecture, user needs, and technical trade-offsâ€¦ you'll build the wrong thing faster.

So yes, watch these agents.
But also learn to engineer, not just automate.

That's where the real future of developers lies ðŸš€

What do you think â€” will autonomous coding agents replace developers, or just change how we work?
